# Instructions for Research Documentation

## Purpose

This folder is intended to organize and centralize all research related to the LMS project. Follow these guidelines to ensure clarity, consistency, and ease of collaboration.

---

## General Guidelines

1. **Folder Structure**:
   - Each folder represents a key research area (e.g., Needs Assessment, Technical Standards, Existing Products).
   - Use subfolders or files to break down topics further, if needed (e.g., “Surveys” under Needs Assessment).

2. **File Naming Conventions**:
   - Use clear and descriptive file names, such as:
     - `User_Feedback_Survey_Results.docx`
     - `SCORM_Standards_Summary.md`
     - `Canvas_Features_Analysis.pdf`

3. **Format of Research Notes**:
   - **Title**: Name of the topic (e.g., "Canvas LMS Features").
   - **Objective**: Why this research is being conducted.
   - **Summary**: Key findings (concise but informative).
   - **References**: Cite sources (use a consistent format, like APA or IEEE). Mendeley can be helpful here if you are familiar.

4. **Version Control**:
   - Add a version number to your document names (e.g., `Needs_Assessment_v1.0.docx`). Doesn't have to be '_v1.0', but anything that adds meaning which can be universally understood is good enough.
   - Indicate changes in a **Changelog** section within the document, if necessary.

## Research Process

### Needs Assessment
- Gather feedback from potential users (students, educators, admins).
- Use surveys, interviews, or focus groups.
- Store raw data (e.g., responses) and processed summaries in this folder.

### Technical Standards
- Document important industry standards. These can be anything that is standard in terms of softwares, design principles, etc.
- Include summaries and links to detailed resources.
- Note how each standard may impact design or development.

### Existing Products
- Analyze popular LMS platforms (e.g., Canvas, Moodle).
- Document strengths, weaknesses, and features worth incorporating or avoiding.
- Use screenshots, diagrams, or feature comparisons where helpful.

### Personal Thoughts
- This folder should contain each collaborators' personal opinions and feedback
- The documentation standard to be follwed is to be determined, but you may add your thoughts however you feel like, using whatever tools you are comfortable with, as long it is in a uniquely identifiable directory.
